# Corona-Virus-Outbreak-Data-Analysis
In this project, we analyzed the Corona Virus dataset  by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). We found some great results like which country got affected the most, what are the number of cases per day, what are the total count of Confirmed, Deaths and Recovered patients. We also plot this data on the GeoPandas world map. The language that I used in this project is Python and the libraries and Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Shapely, Descartes and GeoPandas. I also use Google Colab for the analysis.
